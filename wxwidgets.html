<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)">Erlang</a> is a programming language used mostly on the server side,
although at least one popular graphics-intensive application,
	<a href="http://www.wings3d.com/">Wings 3D</a>,
has been written in it.

The best-supported graphics API for Erlang is
	<a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/">wxWidgets</a>,
a large, mature, stable multi-platform API for GUI programming.

<p>
This tutorial shows you how to use basic wxWidgets in Erlang.

<h2>The How and Why of This Tutorial</h2>

This tutorial's approach is highly interactive:
you make each new wxWidget call work at the Erlang shell command line, first.
You <i>see</i> it work, immediately.
Only afterward do you add it to a program.  For example:
<br>
<br>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5">
 <tr><td>
<p>
To put some text in the status bar, type this at the command line:
<p>
<code>
	wxFrame:setStatusText(F, "Quiet here.").
</code></blockquote>

<p>
Now you should see this:

<p>
<center> <img src="QuietStatus.JPG" /> </center>
</td></tr>
</table>
An example step of the tutorial
</center>

<p>
This approach is better for learning GUI programming.
Here's why:

<ul>
<li><b>Short and clear</b>
<p>Most tutorials rely on GUI code samples for entire programs.
Problem: even the simplest ones can take more than a page.
And they aren't just long, they're <i>wide</i> and <i>dense</i>:
GUI calls can take a lot of parameters.
It's easier to focus on one line (or two) at a time, one result at a time.
The Erlang shell helps you do that.
You'll also see more easily see what you did wrong, when you make mistakes.
</li>

<li><b>Quick feedback</b>
<p>
When you look at GUI code, you often wonder:
what's really happening, and when?
At the command line, you know.
Or you can at least find out.
Immediately.
Before anything else has a chance to happen.
(And if what happened is something wrong, you'll know right then as well.)
</li>
<li><b>Less scary (or less boring)</b>
<p>
Look at any "Hello, World!" program for any GUI, in any language.
If you already know GUI APIs, you'll yawn:
so many inconsequential differences to learn.
If you don't, you'll shudder: <i>so much to learn</i>.
Either way, if you go a few lines at a time, it's easier to take it all in.
</ul>

<a name="keepthosefingersmoving"></a>
<h3>Keep Those Fingers Moving</h3>
<p>
Do you want to get the most out of this tutorial?
Do you have a computer-readable copy of it, on your computer running Erlang?
Then here's the most important thing:
<i>don't copy-paste lines from the tutorial into the shell.</i>
Would you try to learn to speak a language by recording other people's spoken sentences,
then playing them back?
Where the tutorial says to type lines in, <i>type them in.</i>
<p>
It can be hard to resist the temptation to copy-paste.
Print lessons out and work through the hardcopy,
or get them in book form (e-book or dead-tree.)
This helps in another way:
It leaves more screen space.  At times, you'll need it.
You'll have an Erlang shell window,
some GUI elements displayed (one would hope so!),
and often a program editor.
Sometimes you'll want to see them all at the same time.

<a name="objectionoverruled"></a>
<h3>Objection? Overruled!</h3>
<p>
Of course there are drawbacks to this approach.
Nothing's perfect.
Some likely objections:

<ul>
<li>
<i>"Typing in everything means making a lot of mistakes."</i>
<p>
Of course it does.  That's good.  Mistakes help you learn.
</li>
<li>
<i>"It's a lot of typing."</i>
<p>
Maybe you're worried about tendinitis flare-ups?
Consider: stress is also a tendinitis risk factor.
Learning new programming techniques is stressful even when it's fun.
This is a lower-stress way to learn.
Also: you'll be reminded to take a break after each (short) lesson.
Finally, where it's reasonable to do so,
the tutorial will make it easy to 'recycle' lines already typed,
and will use short variable names.
</li>
<li>
<i>"It'll take a lot of time!"</i>

<p>
Face it: you're learning a GUI API.
Those were never small.
These days they're huge.
Getting started will take days.
Delving deeper into the basics will take weeks.
If you're writing a serious GUI for an Erlang program,
you could be at it for months.
And what if your program is successful and becomes popular?
Now we're talking about years.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Ask yourself: how would you be learning otherwise?
By staring at turgid sample code?
Flipping through cryptic manual pages?
Reading a wordy book that too often <i>describes</i> what it could be <i>showing</i> you?
You probably already know how well <i>that</i> works.

<p>
Learning this way is more fun.
It will <i>seem</i>, at least, like it's not taking very long.
It might also mean you learn faster even in real time.
(For one thing, you'll probably procrastinate less.)

<p>
There will be times with wxWidgets when it will be no fun at all.
So why not get started the fun way?

<p>
Why not get started right now?

<a name="settingup"></a>
<h2>Setting Up</h2>
<p>
Unlike systems designed specifically for rapid prototyping of GUIs,
like <a href="http://www.tcl.tk">Tcl/Tk</a>,
there's some preparation required to start doing
graphics from the Erlang shell command line.  This section leads you through the steps.

In this part, it's assumed you that you already
<nl>
 <li>have Erlang installed properly (see <a href="">Appendix A</a> [TBD]);
 </li>
 <li>have <a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/shell.html">
              learned
          </a>
      how to use the Erlang shell;
 </li>
 <li>have the use of a
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor">
         text editor
       </a>appropriate for writing programs.
 </li>
</nl>

<p>
To get started, prepare your Erlang shell session to make understanding easier.

<a name="findthewxheaderfiles"></a>
<h3>Find the wx header files</h3>

<p>
Seeing is believing - but only if you can see things clearly.
Not all <code>wx</code> calls will give you clear graphical results;
In the Erlang shell session, you'll often see only return values.
These values can be cryptic, especially if you're not used to Erlang.
Since Erlang is a functional language,
every <code>wx</code> call returns a value.
Many of these values will be
 <a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/data_types.html#id67146">
  <i>tuples</i>
 </a>.
Many of those tuples will be the contents of
 <a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/records.html">
  <i>records</i>
 </a>.
It's easier to understand <code>wx</code> return values shown in record format.
The Erlang shell needs to be told the <code>wx</code> record definitions, however.
So: where are those record definitions?

<p>
Find where <code>wx</code> lives on your system.  Type this:

<blockquote><code>
	My_wx_dir = code:lib_dir(wx).
</code></blockquote>

On Windows XP, <code>My_wx_dir</code> might look something like this:

<blockquote><code>
	"c:/PROGRA~1/ERL57~1.2/lib/wx-0.98.2"
</code></blockquote>

<a name="readwxmoduledefinitions"></a>
<h3>Read wx module definitions</h3>
Read the <code>wx</code> record definitions from that directory:

<blockquote><code>
	rr (My_wx_dir ++ "/include/wx.hrl").
<br>
	rr (My_wx_dir ++ "/src/wxe.hrl").
</code></blockquote>

Both <code>rr</code> calls should return a list of modules.
If you get the <code>rr</code> calls wrong, you'll get empty lists back.

<p>
Open your text editor, if you haven't already.
Paste the three commands above to a scratch file.
Later,
when you start a new lesson, or resume one,
or when you need to restart because of a crash,
you can copy-paste them into the shell,

Try this now, to make sure it works.
Quit Erlang, restart it, then copy-paste those commands into the shell.

<p>
Unfortunately, we can't use
 <a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/macros.html#id78322">
  Erlang macro definitions
 </a>
in the shell.
That's another good reason to locate the <code>wx.hrl</code>:
to look up <code>wx</code> macro symbol values as needed for shell commands.

<a name="initializewx"></a>
<h3>Initialize <code>wx</code></h3>

<p>
To start <code>wx</code> up, type this:

<blockquote><code>
	Wx=wx:new().
</code> </blockquote>

Did it work?
Maybe there's a message saying
 <a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/installation_guide/INSTALL.html#Support-for-SMP-Symmetric-Multi-Processing">
  SMP (symmetric multiprocessing)
 </a>
isn't enabled,
or "SMP emulator required."
In some Windows Erlang releases, SMP isn't enabled by default.
Exit the Erlang shell and restart it with a "-smp" flag,
e.g., with a DOS command like this:
<blockquote>
 <code>"C:\Program Files\erl5.8.1.1\bin\werl.exe" -smp</code>
</blockquote>

then try again.

<p>
When <code>wx:new()</code> works, you'll get a record back, something like this:

<blockquote><code>
	#wx_ref{ref = 0,type = wx,state = []}
</code> </blockquote>

These are only one per process, and the Erlang shell is a process.
Ignore the value for now.

<a name="framesataste"></a>
<h2>Frames: A Taste</h2>

<p>
In <code>wxWidgets</code>, a window is just a kind of
 <a href="http://docs.wxwidgets.org/2.6/wx_wxframe.html">frame</a>.
Let's make a simple one, then add to it.

<a name="makeaframe"></a>
<h3>Make a frame</h3>

<p>
To make a frame, type this:

<blockquote><code>
	F=wxFrame:new(Wx, -1, "Hello, World!").
</code></blockquote>

<p>
(The second parameter can be an integer ID.
The -1 tells wxWidgets to assign the frame some ID by default.)

<p>
Now, where is this new frame?
We got a record back, something like this:

<blockquote><code>
	#wx_ref{ref = 35,type = wxFrame,state = []}
</code></blockquote>

But nothing changed elsewhere on the screen.
Why not?
Because you must ask to see the frame.

Type this:

<blockquote><code>
	wxFrame:show(F).
</code></blockquote>

This should return <code>true</code>.
Now you should be able to see something like this:

<p>
<center> <img src="blankframe.GIF" /> </center>

<a name="recoveringfromshellexceptions"></a>
<h3>Recovering from shell exceptions</h3>

<p>
To get rid of the frame, you could just click the close control.
But first try this nonsense call instead:

<blockquote><code>
	nothing:doing().
</code></blockquote>

That made the frame disappear, along with the exception error message.
This is because wxWidgets runs the graphics in its own process,
and exceptions not caught in the shell kill any process started there.

<p>
This kind of total GUI loss could happen a lot, just from keying errors.
You'd have to start over whenever you made an exception-raising error.
You don't want to type everything in from the beginning, when it happens.
So, before you do anything else in a shell session, give the command

<blockquote><code>
	catch_exception (true).
	</code>
</blockquote>

You'll probably take breaks from this tutorial anyway.
Set things up so that you can take up where you left off.
Paste what you've typed above into the scratch file.
The commands so far should now look like this:

<blockquote><code>
	catch_exception (true).
<br>
	My_wx_dir = code:lib_dir(wx).
<br>
	rr (My_wx_dir ++ "/include/wx.hrl").
<br>
	rr (My_wx_dir ++ "/src/wxe.hrl").
<br>
	Wx=wx:new().
<br>
	F=wxFrame:new(Wx, -1, "Hello, World!").
<br>
	wxFrame:show(F).
</code></blockquote>

<a name="framescreativedestruction"></a>
<h3>Frames: creative destruction</h3>

<p>
With the frame displayed again, type this:

<blockquote><code>
	wxFrame:destroy(F).
</code></blockquote>

It should return <code>ok</code> and the frame should disappear.

Now, just for fun, make some new frames.
Scroll back through the commands, and, by editing them:
<ol>
<li>Make a <code>wxFrame F1</code> with title "Hey!"</li>
<li>Show <code>F1</code>.</li>
<li>Make a <code>wxFrame F2</code> with title "Boo!"</li>
<li>Show <code>F2</code>.</li>
<li>Then <code>wxFrame:destroy</code> them both.</li>
</ol>

Don't bother pasting those last few commands into your scratch file, though.
We'll be building from where we left off with first <code>destroy</code> call.

<a name="thestatusbar"></a>
<h2>The Status Bar</h2>

<p>
A status bar is handy not just for program features, but also debugging.
At this point, you might want to quit and restart.
Paste your scratchpad contents into the shell.

<a name="makeastatusbar"></a>
<h3>Make a Status Bar</h3>

<p>
Type this in:

<blockquote><code>
	wxFrame:createStatusBar(F).
</code></blockquote>

<p>
Your frame should now look like this:

<p>
<center> <img src="EmptyStatusBar.JPG" /> </center>

<a name="setthestatusbartext"></a>
<h3>Set the Status Bar Text</h3>

<p>
Put some text in the status bar:

<blockquote><code>
	wxFrame:setStatusText(F, "Quiet here.").
</code></blockquote>

<p>
You should now see this:

<p>
<center> <img src="QuietStatus.JPG" /> </center>

<p>
Take a moment to add these commands to your scratchpad startup.
Try setting the status to some other string values, then back to "Quiet here."

<p>
You might also try this:

<blockquote><code>
	SB = wxFrame:getStatusBar(F).
<br>
	wxStatusBar:pushStatusText(SB, "A LITTLE LOUDER NOW.").
<br>
	wxStatusBar:popStatusText(SB).
</code></blockquote>

<p>
You should end up with the same status bar text you started with.

<a name="themenubar"></a>
<h2>The Menu Bar</h2>

Frames in wxWidgets conventionally have one menu bar.
In this way, the menu bar is like the status bar.
However, menu bars are usually made up of other things:
They need to be composed of menus.
<p>
In wxWidgets, complex things are usually composed from the bottom up.
The wxWidgets API makes no assumptions about what goes inside what.
For the more complex things, it takes more steps to make anything you can see.
<p>
Let's get a menu bar visible as soon as possible.
Consider copying each command below to your scratchpad/restart file, as you go.

<a name="makeamenubar"></a>
<h3>Make a Menu Bar</h3>

<p>
Type this:

<p>
<blockquote><code>
	MenuBar = wxMenuBar:new().
</code></blockquote>

<p>
You'll get something like this back:

<p>
<blockquote><code>
	#wx_ref{ref = 37,type = wxMenuBar,state = []}
</code></blockquote>

But you see no menu bar in the window frame.
Nothing changed in the window.
What could be the problem?

<p>
Well, did we say <i>how</i> this menu bar relates to any frame?
<i>You</i> know where you want it to go.
But <code>wx</code> can't read your mind.
Yes, <code>F</code> is your only window frame so far.
But <code>wx</code> doesn't assume you want to put <code>MenuBar</code> in <code>F</code>.

<a name="setthemenubarforaframe"></a>
<h3>Set the Menu Bar for a Frame</h3>

<p>
Try this: making <code>MenuBar</code> a part of <code>wxFrame F</code>.

<p>
<blockquote><code>
	wxFrame:setMenuBar (F, MenuBar).
</code></blockquote>

Maybe that returns <code>ok</code> but ... still you see nothing!
Did anything actually happen?
There's a way to ask about a frame's menu bar.
Type this:

<p>
<blockquote><code>
	wxFrame:getMenuBar (F).
</code></blockquote>

<p>
What do you get back in the shell?
It's the same <code>wx_ref</code> returned from the <code>setMenuBar</code> call. 
Something's happening.
The problem is: there are no menus to show anyway.
Let's do something about that.

<a name="menus"></a>
<h2>Menus</h2>

<p>
It'll take a few steps to add a menu item and display it.

<a name="makeamenu"></a>
<h3>Make a Menu</h3>

<p>
Most application GUIs have a File menu.  Type this:

<blockquote><code>
	FileMn = wxMenu:new().
</code></blockquote>

<p>
You should get something like this:

<p>
<blockquote><code>
	#wx_ref{ref = 37,type = wxMenu,state = []}
</code></blockquote>

<p>
Again, wxWidgets doesn't know where you want this menu to go.
You have to say which menu bar <code>FileMn</code> will attach to.

Add (<code>append</code>) your <code>FileMn</code> to the <code>wxMenuBar</code>
 of <code>wxFrame F</code>.
Use the conventional File menu label.

<p>
<blockquote><code>
	wxMenuBar:append (MenuBar, FileMn, "&File").
</code></blockquote>

<p>
(The ampersand before 'F' means that entering Alt-F will be like clicking on the menu.)
<p>
You should see a change -- something like this:
<p>
<center> <img src="FileMenu.JPG" /> </center>

<p>
But what good is a menu without menu items?
Click on the File menu (or press Alt F).
Nothing happens.

<blockquote><b>[Well, the status bar clears.  What's with that?]</b></blockquote>

<a name="addamenuitem"></a>
<h3>Add a Menu Item</h3>

<p>
Every File menu has a Quit menu item.
Let's make one.
Type this:

<p>
<blockquote><code>
	Quit = wxMenuItem:new ([{id,400},{text, "&Quit"}]).
</code></blockquote>

<p>(The menu item ID -- 400 here -- must be specified;
without one, wxWidgets won't generate a default,
and you won't get a menu item. <b>CHECK THIS.</b>)

<p>
Again, you won't see any graphical change, just a return value in the shell.
A menu is like a menu bar: you need to add something to make it visible.

<p>
<blockquote><code>
	wxMenu:append (FileMn, Quit).
</code></blockquote>

<p>
Click on the File menu (or type Alt F).  You should see this:

<p>
<center> <img src="FileQuit.JPG" /> </center>

<p>
Reviewing all the commands for the simple menu you've made, you should see:

<blockquote><code>
MenuBar = wxMenuBar:new().
<br>
wxFrame:setMenuBar (F, MenuBar).
<br>
FileMn = wxMenu:new().
<br>
wxMenuBar:append (MenuBar, FileMn,"&File").
<br>
Quit = wxMenuItem:new ([{id,400},{text, "&Quit"}]).
<br>
wxMenu:append (FileMn, Quit).
</code></blockquote>

<p>
What else can we add?
Every decent app has a Help menu.
And every Help menu should have an About item.

<a name=makeahelpmenu></a>
<h3>Make a Help Menu</h3>
<p>
Recycle your <code>new</code> and <code>append</code> commands above.

<p>
<blockquote><code>
	HelpMn = wxMenu:new().
<br>
	wxMenuBar:append (MenuBar, HelpMn, "&Help").
<br>
</code></blockquote>

<p>You should see something like this:

<p>
<center> <img src="MenuAbout.JPG" /> </center>

<p>
Now add the About menu item.
Recycle the commands you used to add the Quit item to the File Menu.
You'll put together commands like this (note the different id value):

<blockquote><code>
	About = wxMenuItem:new ([{id,500},{text,"About"}]).
<br>
	wxMenu:append (HelpMn, About).
</code></blockquote>

<p>
Click on the Help menu. 
You should see something like this:

<p>
<center> <img src="HelpAbout.JPG" /> </center>

<p>
Take a moment to copy-paste the above commands to your scratchpad.

<a name="events"></a>
<h2>Events</h2>

<p>
Up to now, we've done nothing with events.
You might think there are no events to see.
If you entered "<code>flush()</code>" now, you'd see nothing.
But in fact, every mouse click is triggering events inside wxWidgets.
They are being handled in some default manner by <code>wx</code>.
Often, the <code>wx</code> default is to ignore them.
Let's catch an event, to see what it looks like.

<a name="usingconnecttoseeevents"></a>
<h3>Using <code>connect</code> to see events</h3>
<p>
Type this:

<blockquote><code>
	wxFrame:connect (F, close_window).
</code></blockquote>

<p>
Click on the close control for the frame, then type this:

<p>
<blockquote><code>
	flush().
</code></blockquote>

<p>
You should get back something like this:

<blockquote><code>
	Shell got {wx,-202,{wx_ref,35,wxFrame,[]},[],{wxClose,close_window}}
</code></blockquote>

<p>
Note that clicking the close control doesn't close the window frame anymore.
You've overridden the default action.

<p>
Click on that control a few times, then minimize and maximize the window.
Try calling <code>flush</code> again.
You see your <code>close_window</code> events, but no minimize/maximize events.

<p>
Also note how the Erlang shell writes out received events:
It doesn't use the <code>wx</code> record definitions read in earlier.
You're just seeing raw tuples.
This makes it harder to know what these <code>wx</code> events are about.

<p>
There's a way to see the events using the record definitions.
The following fun returns an event sent to the shell (or <code>empty</code>, if none).
Type it in:

<p>
<blockquote><code>
	Ev = fun() -> receive E->E after 0 -> empty end end.
</code></blockquote>

<p>
Click on the close control again, then call the event-reader.

<blockquote><code>
	Ev().
</code></blockquote>

<p>
You should see something like this:

<blockquote><code>
<pre>
#wx{id = -202,
    obj = #wx_ref{ref = 35,type = wxFrame,state = []},
    userData = [],
    event = #wxClose{type = close_window}}
</pre>
</code></blockquote>

<h3>Menu selection events</h3>
<p>
Let's try connecting to more events.  Type this:

<p>
<blockquote><code>
	wxFrame:connect (F, command_menu_selected).
</code></blockquote>

<p>
Now try some menu selections.
Select the File menu's Quit, then the Help menu's About.
Then enter <code>Ev()</code> to look at the events generated.
Except for <code>id</code>, the resulting events are the same.

<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>
#wx{id = 400,
    obj = #wx_ref{ref = 35,type = wxFrame,state = []},
                  userData = [],
                  event = #wxCommand{type = command_menu_selected,
				     cmdString = [],
				     commandInt = 0,
				     extraLong = 0}}
</pre>
</code></blockquote>

<h3>Callbacks</h3>

<p>
It's good to know that events are happening.
Sometimes it's helpful to be able to see the details.
But most of the time,
we just want (non-default) things to <i>happen</i> in response to events.
So we have to catch events and figure out what to do with them.
<p>
Events in <code>wx</code> are handled in
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callback_(computer_programming)">
  <i>callback</i> functions.
 </a>
First, let's make a function to call.
Type this:

<p>
<blockquote><code>
	Ding = fun (_,_) -> wx_misc:bell() end.
</code></blockquote>

<p>
Try it, using the types of parameters expected for these callbacks:

<p>
<blockquote><code>
	Ding(#wx{},#wx_ref{}).
</code></blockquote>

<p>
Does it ring a bell? 
It should.

<p>
Now connect it to your <code>wxFrame F</code> through the event <code>close_window</code>

<p>
<blockquote><code>
	wxFrame:connect (F, close_window, [{callback, Ding}]).
</code></blockquote>

<p>
Try clicking the close control on the frame again.
It should just beep.
Try calling <code>Ev</code>.
It should no longer return <code>close_window</code> events.

<p>
Because simply beeping is a non-sensical thing to do for the close control,
you might want to disconnect the event now.

<p>
<blockquote><code>
	wxFrame:disconnect (F, close_window).
</code></blockquote>

<p>
<a name=dialogs></a>
<h2>Dialogs</h2>

<p>
An "About" menu item really ought to take us to a modal dialog.
But how do you make one?
Here's the simplest way.

<a name=makingamodaldialog></a>
<h3>Making a modal dialog</h3>

<p>
Type the following line:

<blockquote><code>
	D = wxMessageDialog:new (F, "Let's talk.").
</code></blockquote>

<p>
This should return <code>true</code> but will show nothing graphically.

<a name=showingamodaldialog></a>
<h3>Showing a modal dialog</h3>

<p>
To show the dialog and interact with it, type this:

<p>
<blockquote><code>
	wxMessageDialog:showModal (D).
</code></blockquote>

<p>
Somewhere on your screen,
you should now see something like this:

<p>
<center> <img src="dialog.png" /> </center>

<p>
Because the dialog is modal,
the <code>showModal</code> call won't return with a value in the shell
until you hit the "OK" button.
The return value should be 5100.
If you look at the include file wx.hrl,
you'll see that this is the value for <code>wxID_OK</code>.
